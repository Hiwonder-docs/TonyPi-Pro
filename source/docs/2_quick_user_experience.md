iOS: Search for [WonderPi]() in the App Store and download the app.

Users can control TonyPi using the [WonderPi]() mobile app. This section explains how to connect TonyPi to the app.

### 2.1.2 Device Connection

Upon successful startup, the robot will automatically generate a hotspot with a name beginning with **"HW."** Connect your phone's app to this hotspot to access and activate additional features.

* **Connection Mode Overview**

The robot supports two network modes:

(1) **AP Direct Connection Mode:** The development board creates a hotspot that your phone can connect to. 

:::{Note}
This mode does not provide access to external networks.
:::

(2) **STA Local Area Network (LAN) Mode:** The development board connects to a specified Wi-Fi hotspot, allowing access to external networks.

These two modes cannot be used simultaneously. By default, the robot operates in AP Direct Connection Mode. Regardless of which mode you choose, the available features and functions remain the same.

We recommend starting with the AP Direct Connection Mode for initial setup and experience. You can switch to LAN Mode later if needed.

* **Direct Connection Mode (MUST READ)**

This section uses the Android version as an example, but the steps also apply to iOS.

(1) Open the mobile app and, on the home interface, select **"Advanced"**, then choose **"TonyPi"**.

### 2.3.3 Adjust Color Threshold

(1) Open the color threshold adjustment screen and select the color you want to adjustâ€”for example, red.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_3/media/image19.png" class="common_img" />

(2) Place the red object within the camera's view. Set the minimum values of L, A, and B components to 0, and the maximum values to 255.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_3/media/image20.png" class="common_img" />

(3) Click the **"Instructions"** button to see how to adjust the color thresholds.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_3/media/image21.png" class="common_img" />

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_3/media/image22.png" class="common_img" />

:::{Note}
To close the instructions window, click **"OK."**
:::

(4) Since red is closer to the positive side of the A component in the LAB color space, start by adjusting the A values.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_3/media/image23.png" class="common_img" />

(5) Leave `a_max` unchanged and gradually increase `a_min` until the red object appears white in the processed image while the background turns black.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_3/media/image24.png" class="common_img" />

(6) Adjust the L (lightness) and B (chroma) values depending on the lighting conditions:

- If the red looks too light, raise the minimum brightness (`L_min`).
- If it looks too dark, lower the maximum brightness (`L_max`).
- If the red appears too warm, increase the minimum chroma (`b_min`).
- If it looks too cool, decrease the maximum chroma (`b_max`).

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_3/media/image25.png" class="common_img" />

(7) When you're satisfied with the settings, click **"Save"** to keep the new threshold values.
