### 9.1.3 Hurdle Assembly

The assembly steps are as follows:

(1) Place the white hurdle accessory at the end of the blue hurdle accessory.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/10.ai_autonomous_omnibus/1.1/image6.png" />

(2) Fix the white hurdle accessory to the end of the blue hurdle with M3*20 flat head self-tapping screw, as the figure shown below:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/10.ai_autonomous_omnibus/1.1/image7.png" />

(3) Then,  assemble the other white  hurdle  accessory,  as  the figure  shown below:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/10.ai_autonomous_omnibus/1.1/image8.png" />

### 9.1.4 Map Placement

Before playing this game, let’s have a look at the map. The map is composed of three parts: 

 ① step placement area 

 ② hurdle placement area 

 ③ black track Its distribution is as follows:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/10.ai_autonomous_omnibus/1.1/image9.png" />

**1.4.1 Step Placement Area**

This area is used to place step that has been stuck with tape and the specific placement position is as follows:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/10.ai_autonomous_omnibus/1.1/image10.png" />

**1.4.2 Hurdle Placement Area**

This hurdle placement area is used to place two assembled hurdles and the specific placement position is as follows:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/10.ai_autonomous_omnibus/1.1/image11.png" />

## 9.2 Go Up and Down Stair

### 9.2.1 Getting Ready

Place the  map on a flat and smooth surface and set the step in the corresponding position.

The specific placement method for the map and tools can refer to the video and tutorial in “**[Tools Assembly and Map Placement](#anchor_1)**”.

### 9.2.2 Working Principle

The working principle of this this lesson is as follow:

The color is recognized through  Lab color space firstly. Then convert  RGB color into Lab color space, and proceed binarization, and dilation and erosion process to obtain the contour of the target color. Mark the target color with blue line, and obtain the coordinate parameter of the target to complete the color recognition.

Next,  control  the  robot  to  move  toward  the  step.  According  to  the  target coordinate to judge, if the robot is in the middle position of the target red line, it will be controlled to move forward and approach the step. When it reaches to the  set  range,  the  action  of  going  up  and  down  step  will  be  executed. Otherwise, control robot to move left or right to the middle of the target, and then execute the action of going up and down the step.

import hiwonder.ActionGroupControl as AGC
import hiwonder.yaml_handle as yaml_handle
```

* **Set initial state** 

Set initial state, including the initial position of servo, color threshold, action group name, etc.

{lineno-start=54}

```py
# 初始位置
def initMove():
    ctl.set_pwm_servo_pulse(1,servo_data['servo1'],500)
    ctl.set_pwm_servo_pulse(2,servo_data['servo2'],500)   

object_left_x, object_right_x, object_center_y, object_angle = -2, -2, -2, 0
strp_up = True
```

{lineno-start=25}

```py
go_forward = 'go_forward'
go_forward_one_step = 'go_forward_one_step'
go_forward_one_small_step = 'go_forward_one_small_step'
turn_right = 'turn_right_small_step_a'
turn_left  = 'turn_left_small_step_a'        
left_move = 'left_move_20'
right_move = 'right_move_20'
go_turn_right = 'turn_right'
go_turn_left = 'turn_left'
```

* **Image pre-processing** 

Resizing and Gaussian blur processing of the image.

{lineno-start=165}

```py
frame resize = cv2.resize(img copy, size, interpolation=CV2.INTER NEAREST)
frame gb = cv2.GaussianBlur(frame resize, (3, 3), 3)
```

`cv2.resize(img_copy, size, interpolation=cv2.INTER_NEAREST)` is an operation to resize the image.

The first parameter `img_copy` is the image to be resized.

The second parameter `size` is the target size.

The third parameter `interpolation` is the interpolation method, which is used to determine the pixel interpolation algorithm used for resizing.

`cv2.GaussianBlur(frame_resize, (3, 3), 3)` applies Gaussian blur to the image.

The first parameter `frame_resize` is the image to be blurred.

The second parameter `(3, 3)` is the size of the Gaussian kernel, indicating that the width and height of the kernel are both 3.

The third parameter `3` is the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel, used to control the degree of blur.

* **Color space conversion** 

Convert the BGR image to LAB image.

{lineno-start=168}

```py
frame_lab = cv2.cvtColor(GaussianBlur_img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2LAB) #将图像转换到LAB空间
```

* **Binarization processing** 

Use `inRange()` function in cv2 library to process binarization.

{lineno-start=174}

```py
if i in lab_data:
    frame_mask =cv2.inRange(frame lab, 
                            (lab_data[i]['min'][0], 
                             Lab_data[i]['min'][1],
                             Lab_data[i]['min'][2],
                             Lab_data[i]['max'][0],
                             Lab_data[i]['max'][1],
                             Lab_data[i]['max'][2]))  # 对原图像和掩模进行位运算
```

The first parameter `frame_lab` is inputting image.

The second parameter `lab_data[i]['min'][0]` is the lower limit of the threshold.

The third parameter `lab_data[i]['max'][0]` is the upper limit of the threshold.

(1) Opening and closing operation

{lineno-start=131}

```py
opened = cv2.morphologyEx(frame_mask, cv2.MORPH_OPEN, np.ones((3,3),np.uint8))#开运算
closed = cv2.morphologyEx(opened, cv2.MORPH_CLOSE, np.ones((3,3),np.uint8))#闭运算
```

`eroded = cv2.erode(frame_mask, cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_RECT, (3, 3)))` is the operation to perform corrosion on the binary image.

The first parameter `frame_mask` is the binary image on which morphological operations are to be performed.

The second parameter `cv2.MORPH_OPEN` specifies performing the opening operation.

The third parameter `np.ones((3, 3), np.uint8)` is the structuring element for morphological operations, used to define the shape and size of the operation. Here, a 3x3 matrix filled with ones is used as the structuring element.

The same logic applies to the closing operation function.

* **Get the contour with the largest area** 

After completing the above image processing, it is necessary to obtain the contours of the recognized targets. This involves using the `findContours()` function from the cv2 library.

{lineno-start=133}

```py
contours = cv2.findContours(closed, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_NONE)[-2] #找出所有外轮廓
areaMax_contour = getAreaMaxContour(contours, area_min=50)[0] #找到最大的轮廓
```

Take code `contours = cv2.findContours(dilated, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_NONE)[-2]` as example:

The first parameter `dilated` is inputting image.

The second parameter `cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL` is the contour retrieval mode.

The third parameter `cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_NONE)[-2]` is the contour approximation method.

Find the contour with the largest area in the obtained contour. In order to avoid interference, you need to set a minimum value. The target contour is considered valid only if its area is greater than this value.

* **Obtain the coordinates of the bottom and left/right sides of the contour, then perform mapping** 

Use the `areaMax_contour` function to obtain the coordinates of the bottom and left/right sides. Then, calculate the distances from the bottom to the left and right sides using the Euclidean distance formula.

{lineno-start=137}

```py
if areaMax_contour is not None:

    down_x = (areaMax_contour[areaMax_contour[:,:,1].argmax()][0])[0]
    down_y = (areaMax_contour[areaMax_contour[:,:,1].argmax()][0])[1]

    left_x = (areaMax_contour[areaMax_contour[:,:,0].argmin()][0])[0]
    left_y = (areaMax_contour[areaMax_contour[:,:,0].argmin()][0])[1]

    right_x = (areaMax_contour[areaMax_contour[:,:,0].argmax()][0])[0]
    right_y = (areaMax_contour[areaMax_contour[:,:,0].argmax()][0])[1]

    if pow(down_x - left_x, 2) + pow(down_y - left_y, 2) > pow(down_x - right_x, 2) + pow(down_y - right_y, 2):
        left_x = int(Misc.map(left_x, 0, size[0], 0, img_w))
        left_y = int(Misc.map(left_y, 0, size[1], 0, img_h))  
        right_x = int(Misc.map(down_x, 0, size[0], 0, img_w))
        right_y = int(Misc.map(down_y, 0, size[1], 0, img_h))
    else:
        left_x = int(Misc.map(down_x, 0, size[0], 0, img_w))
        left_y = int(Misc.map(down_y, 0, size[1], 0, img_h))
        right_x = int(Misc.map(right_x, 0, size[0], 0, img_w))
        right_y = int(Misc.map(right_y, 0, size[1], 0, img_h))
```

* **Draw line contour** 

{lineno-start=159}

```
center_y = int(Misc.map((areaMax_contour[areaMax_contour[:,:,1].argmax()][0])[1], 0, size[1], 0, img_h))
angle = int(math.degrees(math.atan2(right_y - left_y, right_x - left_x)))

cv2.line(img_draw, (left_x, left_y), (right_x, right_y), (255, 0, 0), 2)
```

Use the OpenCV function `cv2.line` to draw a line segment on the image.

`img_draw`： the image on which the line segment is to be drawn.

`(left_x, left_y)` and `(right_x, right_y)`： the coordinates of the starting and ending points of the line segment.

`(255, 0, 0)`：the color of the line segment, which is blue here (in the BGR color space).

`2`：The thickness of the line segment.

* **Go up and down stair** 

① Detecting stair： detect the position of the stair using the value of “object_center_y”.

② Slightly adjust the position： calculate the center x coordinate “object_x”.

③ Quick approach： If the center y coordinate is less than 320 and the difference between the center x and the robot's center x is less than 150, the robot will execute a forward action to quickly approach the steps.

④ Angle adjustment： based on the value of “object_angle”, the robot will decide whether to turn right or left to adjust the angle with the stair.

⑤ Left and right adjustment： if the difference between the center x and the robot’s center x exceeds a certain threshold, the robot will execute a left or right movement action to adjust its lateral position.

**⑥ **Slightly adjust the angle： within the range of 3 to 20 degrees, the robot will execute slightly adjustment to more precisely adjust the angle with the stair.

⑦ At the center of the steps： If the object's center y coordinate is between 320 and 430, the robot will execute a step forward action.

⑧ Approaching the stair： If the object's center y coordinate is greater than or equal to 430, the robot will wait for a period of time and check if the y coordinate is still greater than or equal to 430. If it is, the robot will emit an audible alert and execute a series of small step forward actions.

⑨ Ascending and descending stairs： If the robot was previously flagged as ready to ascend the stairs (strp_up is True), it will execute the action to ascend the stairs and reset the strp_up flag. Otherwise, it will execute the default action to descend the stairs.

The purpose of this code is to enable the robot to automatically identify and handle stairs, whether ascending or descending, in a relatively safe and precise manner. Through a series of conditional checks and action executions, the robot can respond appropriately based on the position of the stairs and its own relative position.

{lineno-start=174}

```py
while True:
    if robot_is_running:
        if object_center_y >= 0:  #检测到台阶,进行位置微调  
            object_x = object_left_x + (object_right_x - object_left_x)/2

            if object_center_y < 320 and abs(object_x - centreX) < 150:  #快速靠近

            elif 320 <= object_center_y < 450:   #在中心
                AGC.runActionGroup(go_forward_one_step)
                time.sleep(0.2)

            elif object_center_y >= 450: #位置靠近，可以跨栏或者上下台阶
                time.sleep(0.8)
                if object_center_y >= 450:
                    board.set_buzzer(1900, 0.1, 0.9, 1) 
                    for i in range(3):
                        AGC.runActionGroup(go_forward_one_small_step) #前进一小步
                        time.sleep(0.5)

                        if strp_up: # 上台阶
                            AGC.runActionGroup('climb_stairs')
                            strp_up = False
                        else:       # 下台阶
                            AGC.runActionGroup(go_forward_one_small_step) #前进一步
                            time.sleep(0.5)
                            AGC.runActionGroup('down_floor')
                            strp_up = True
                            time.sleep(0.5)
                            object_center_y = -1
```

Take code `AGC.runActionGroup('grab_right')` as example:

Use `AGC.runActionGroup` function to call action group. `grab_right` is the name of action group.
### 9.2.6 Function Extension

<p id="anchor_2_5_1"></p>

* **Modify Climbing Position** 

The program defaults that the robot starts going up and down step at a distance of 1000 from the line after the robot detects the red line on the step. If you want the robot to get closer to the stairs before starting to climbing, the data needs to be decreased; If you want the robot to move further away from the step  before  starting to  climbing,  the  data  needs to  be  increased.  This section takes set the distance from the line at position 1020 where the robot starts climbing the stair. You can refer to the following steps to operate.

(1) Input “cd /home/pi/TonyPi/Extend/athletics_course/” and press Enter to go to the directory of the game program.

```commandline
cd /home/pi/TonyPi/Extend/athletics_course/
```

(2) Enter command “vim Stairway.py” and press “ Enter” to open the game programming file.

```commandline
vim stairway.py
```

(3) Find the code framed in the following figure:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/10.ai_autonomous_omnibus/2.1/image12.png"  />

(3) After modification, refer to step (6) in "[9.2.6 Function Extension ->Modify Climbing Position](#anchor_2_5_1)" to save the modified code.

## 9.3 Hurdle Clearing

### 9.3.1 Getting Ready

Place the map on a flat and smooth surface and set the hurdle in the corresponding position on the map.

The specific placement method for the map and tool can refer to the video and file in "[Tools Assembly and Map Placement](#anchor_1)".

### 9.3.2 Working Principle

The working principle of this this lesson is as follow:

The color is recognized through  Lab color space firstly. Then convert  RGB color into Lab color space, and proceed binarization, and dilation and erosion process to obtain the contour of the target color. Mark the target color with blue line, and obtain the coordinate parameter of the target to complete the color recognition.

Next, control the  robot to  move toward the  hurdle. According to the target coordinate to judge, if the robot is in the middle of the target hurdle, it will move forward. When reaching to the set range, it will execute the hurdling action. Otherwise, control robot to move left or right to the middle of the target, and then execute the hurdling action.

(1) Import function library

In this initialization step, the first task is to import the required libraries for subsequent program calls. For details on the imports, refer to [9.3.5 Program Analysis->Import parameter module](#anchor_3_6_1).

{lineno-start=4}

```py
import os
import sys
import cv2
import time
import math
import threading
import numpy as np

import hiwonder.PID as PID
import hiwonder.Misc as Misc
import hiwonder.ros_robot_controller_sdk as rrc
from hiwonder.Controller import Controller
import hiwonder.Camera as Camera
import hiwonder.ActionGroupControl as AGC
import hiwonder.yaml_handle as yaml_handle
```

(2) Set initial state

Set initial state, including the initial position of servo, color threshold, etc.

{lineno-start=55}

```py
# 初始位置
def initMove():
    ctl.set_pwm_servo_pulse(1,servo_data['servo1'],500)
    ctl.set_pwm_servo_pulse(2,servo_data['servo2'],500) 
```

(3) Image pre-processing

Resizing and Gaussian blur processing of the image.

{lineno-start=122}

```py
img_resize = cv2.resize(img, (size[0], size[1]), interpolation = cv2.INTER_CUBIC)
GaussianBlur_img = cv2.GaussianBlur(img_resize, (3, 3), 0)#高斯模糊
```

`cv2.resize(img_copy, size, interpolation=cv2.INTER_NEAREST)` is an operation to resize the image.

The first parameter `img_copy` is the image to be resized.

The second parameter `size` is the target size.

The third parameter `interpolation` is the interpolation method, which is used to determine the pixel interpolation algorithm used for resizing.

`cv2.GaussianBlur(frame_resize, (3, 3), 3)` applies Gaussian blur to the image.

The first parameter `frame_resize` is the image to be blurred.

The second parameter `(3, 3)` is the size of the Gaussian kernel, indicating that the width and height of the kernel are both 3.

The third parameter `3` is the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel, used to control the degree of blur.

(4) Color space conversion

Convert the BGR image to LAB image.

{lineno-start=124}

```py
frame_lab = cv2.cvtColor(GaussianBlur_img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2LAB) #将图像转换到LAB空间
```

(5) Binarization processing

Use `inRange()` function in cv2 library to process binarization.

{lineno-start=125}

```py
frame_mask = cv2.inRange(frame_lab,
                         (lab_data[target_color]['min'][0],
                          lab_data[target_color]['min'][1],
                          lab_data[target_color]['min'][2]),
                         (lab_data[target_color]['max'][0],
                          lab_data[target_color]['max'][1],
                          lab_data[target_color]['max'][2]))  #对原图像和掩模进行位运算
```

The first parameter `frame_lab` is inputting image.

The second parameter `lab_data[i]['min'][0]` is the lower limit of the threshold.

The third parameter `lab_data[i]['max'][0]` is the upper limit of the threshold.

(6) Corrosion and inflation

{lineno-start=132}

```py
opened = cv2.morphologyEx(frame_mask, cv2.MORPH_OPEN, np.ones((3,3),np.uint8))#开运算
closed = cv2.morphologyEx(opened, cv2.MORPH_CLOSE, np.ones((3,3),np.uint8))#闭运算
```

`eroded = cv2.erode(frame_mask, cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_RECT, (3, 3)))` is the operation to perform corrosion on the binary image.

The first parameter `frame_mask` is the binary image on which morphological operations are to be performed.

The second parameter `cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_RECT, (3, 3))` is the structuring element for the corrosion operation. A rectangular structuring element of size (3, 3) is used here.

(7) The dilation function follows the same principle.

Specify the color of the item to obtain angle information

{lineno-start=242}

```py
# 跨栏
object_left_x, object_right_x, object_center_y, object_angle = color_identify(img_copy.copy(), img_copy, target_color = 'blue')
print('hurdles',object_left_x, object_right_x, object_center_y, object_angle)# 打印位置角度参数
```

(8) Get the contour with the largest area

After completing the above image processing, it is necessary to obtain the contours of the recognized targets. This involves using the “findContours()” function from the cv2 library.

{lineno-start=134}

```py
contours = cv2.findContours(closed, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_NONE)[-2]  #找出搜友外轮廓
```

Take code `contours = cv2.findContours(dilated, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_NONE)[-2]` as example:

The first parameter `dilated` is inputting image.

The second parameter `cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL` is the contour retrieval mode.

The third parameter `cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_NONE)[-2]` is the contour approximation method.

Find the contour with the largest area in the obtained contour. In order to avoid interference, you need to set a minimum value. The target contour is considered valid only if its area is greater than this value.

{lineno-start=135}

```py
areaMax_contour = getAreaMaxContour(contours, area_min=50)[0] #找到最大的轮廓
```

Detect the hurdle and perform fine-tuning of its position

{lineno-start=174}

```py
while True:
    if robot_is_running:
        if boject_center_y >= 0: # 检测到跨栏，进行位置微调
            object_x = object_left_x + (object_right_x - object_left_x)/2
```

Continuously monitor the robot's operating status (robot_is_running) and the position information of the object (object_center_y) through a loop. If a hurdle is detected (object_center_y >= 0), perform position fine-tuning and action control based on the position and angle information of the object.

If far from the railing, approach quickly

{lineno-start=180}

```py
if object_center_y < 320 and abs(object_x - centereX) < 150:  #离栏杆比较远，快速靠近
    AGC.runActionGroup(go_forward)
    time.sleep(0.2)
```

If far from the railing, call the forward action group to approach quickly

Perform position slightly adjustment and action control based on the object's position and angle information, approaching the railing, turning, and adjusting left and right

{lineno-start=184}

```py
elif 20 <= object_angle < 90:  #角度调整
    AGC.runActionGroup(go_turn_right)
    time.sleep(0.2)           
elif -20 >= object_angle > -90:
    AGC.runActionGroup(go_turn_left)
    time.sleep(0.2)

elif object_x - centreX > 15: #左右调整，让机器人正对栏杆
    AGC.runActionGroup(right_move)
elif object_x - centreX < -15:
    AGC.runActionGroup(left_move)

elif 3 < object_angle < 20:   #角度微调
    AGC.runActionGroup(turn_right)
    time.sleep(0.2)           
elif -5 > object_angle > -20:
    AGC.runActionGroup(turn_left)
    time.sleep(0.2)

elif 320 <= object_center_y < 470:   #慢慢靠近栏杆
    AGC.runActionGroup(go_forward_one_step)
    time.sleep(0.5)
```

If the angle is between 20 and 90 degrees, it indicates that the angle needs a slight adjustment to the right, and the robot turns right.

If the angle is between -90 and -20 degrees, it indicates that the angle needs a slight adjustment to the left, and the robot turns left.

If the difference between the object's center x coordinate (object_x) and the center point (centreX) is greater than 15 pixels, it indicates that the color block is on the right side of the center point. The robot moves to the right.

If the difference between the object's center x coordinate (object_x) and the center point (centreX) is less than -15 pixels, it indicates that the color block is on the left side of the center point. The robot moves to the left.

If the angle of the color block is between 3 and 20 degrees, it indicates that the angle needs a slight adjustment to the right. The robot turns right.

If the angle of the color block is between -20 and -5 degrees, it indicates that the angle needs a slight adjustment to the left. The robot turns left.

- #### Close to the position, cross the hurdle

  {lineno-start=207}

```py
elif object_center_y >= 470: #位置靠近，跨栏
    time.sleep(0.8)
    if object_center_y >= 470:
        board.set_buzzer(1900, 0.1, 0.9, 1)
        for i in range(3):
            AGC.runActionGroup(go_forward_one_small_step) #前进一小步
            time.sleep(0.5)

            AGC.runActionGroup('hurdles')
            time.sleep(0.5)
            object_center_y = -1
```

If the color block's center point position is greater than or equal to 430 pixels, it indicates that the robot is close to the railing. Execute the hurdle-crossing action and reset object_center_y to -1 to indicate that the hurdle-crossing is completed.
### 9.3.6 Function Extension

## 9.4 Athletics Performance

### 9.4.1 Getting Ready

Place the map on a flat and smooth surface and set the stair in the corresponding position on the map.

The specific placement method for the map and tool can refer to the video and file in "**[Tools Assembly and Map Placement](#anchor_1)**".

### 9.4.2 Working Principle

As we all know, a robot is a device imitating human. In this lesson, we combine “Climb Stair” and “ Hurdle” to simulate robots to learn human athletics sport.

The color is recognized through  Lab color space firstly. Then convert  RGB color into Lab color space, and proceed binarization, and dilation and erosion process to obtain the contour of the target color. Mark the target color with blue line, and obtain the coordinate parameter of the target to complete the color recognition.

Then process the servo on the pan-tilt of the head after recognition, the x and y coordinates of the center point of the image are used as set values, and the currently acquired x and y coordinates are used as input values to update the pid.

Then calculate according to the feedback of the line position in the image, and finally make the robot move along the line through the change of position, so as to control the robot to walk along the black line.

Then, if you encounter step or hurdle in the middle, please refer to “ Lesson 2 Climb step” and “ Lesson 3 Hurdle”.

### 9.4.3 Operation Steps

:::{Note}
The entered command must pay attention to case sensitivity and space.
:::

(1) Turn on the robot and connect to Raspberry Pi desktop with VNC.

(2) Click the icon <img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/10.ai_autonomous_omnibus/4.1/image3.png" style="width:50px" /> on the upper left corner of the desktop to open command line terminal. Enter “cd /home/pi/TonyPi/Extend/athletics_course/” and press Enter to go to the directory of the game progrma.

```commandline
cd /home/pi/TonyPi/Extend/athletics_course/
```

(3) Enter command “python3 athletics_perform.py” and press Enter to start the game.

```commandline
python3 athletics_perform.py
```

(4) If want to exit the game, press “Ctrl+C” in the LX terminal. Please try multiple times if fail to exit.

### 9.4.4 Project Outcome

:::{Note}
- In  this  game,  the robot’s hands can not be replaced with novel robotic hands. Otherwise, it will change robot's center of mass and affect experience.
- The robot needs to be placed in a smooth and flat surface to avoid falling.  
- The  background color does  not be similar to red, black and blue to get better experience.
- The height of the step and hurdle should be kept at 1cm, and the two ends of step need to be affixed with the red tape.
:::

Place the map on a flat and smooth surface, and place step and hurdle on the corresponding position on the map. Then place the robot on the black line of map.

After  starting  this  game,  the  robot  will  walk  along  the  black  line.  When encounter a step, it will automatically go up and down step. When encounters a hurdle, it will go over it.

{lineno-start=165}

```py
img_resize = cv2.resize(img, (size[0], size[1]), interpolation = cv2.INTER_CUBIC)
GaussianBlur_img = cv2.GaussianBlur(img_resize, (3, 3), 0)#高斯模糊
```

`cv2.resize(img_copy, size, interpolation=cv2.INTER_NEAREST)` is an operation to resize the image.

The first parameter `img_copy` is the image to be resized.

The second parameter `size` is the target size.

The third parameter `interpolation` is the interpolation method, which is used to determine the pixel interpolation algorithm used for resizing.

`cv2.GaussianBlur(frame_resize, (3, 3), 3)` applies Gaussian blur to the image.

The first parameter `frame_resize` is the image to be blurred.

The second parameter `(3, 3)` is the size of the Gaussian kernel, indicating that the width and height of the kernel are both 3.

The third parameter `3` is the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel, used to control the degree of blur.

**(4) Convert the BGR image to LAB image.**

**① Binarization processing**

Use `inRange()` function in cv2 library to process binarization.

{lineno-start=167}

The dilation function follows the same principle.

Specify the color of the item to obtain angle information and set the line-following color.

{lineno-start=313}

```py
# 巡线
line_centerx = line_patrol(img, img_copy, target_color = 'black') 

# 跨栏
if skip == 1:
    object_left_x, object_right_x, object_center_y, object_angle = color_identify(img, img_copy, target_color = 'blue')

```

 (5) Get the contour with the largest area

After completing the above image processing, it is necessary to obtain the contours of the recognized targets. This involves using the “findContours()” function from the cv2 library.

```

Continuously monitor the robot's operating status (robot_is_running) and the position information of the object (object_center_y) through a loop. If a hurdle is detected (object_center_y >= 0), perform position fine-tuning and action control based on the position and angle information of the object.

If far from the railing, approach quickly.

{lineno-start=251}

```py
elif object_center_y >= 430:#离栏杆比较远，快速靠近

        time.sleep(0.5)
        AGC.runActionGroup(go_forward_one_step) #前进一步
        time.sleep(0.5)

        if items == 'hurdles':# 跨栏

            AGC.runActionGroup('hurdles')
            skip_st = True
            strp_up = True
            items = None
        elif items == 'stairway':
            if strp_up: # 上台阶
                AGC.runActionGroup('climb_stairs')

                time.sleep(0.5)
                object_center_y = -1
```

If the object's angle is between 20 and 90 degrees, execute the “go_turn_righ” action group and delay for 0.2 seconds.

If the object's angle is between -20 and -90 degrees, execute the “go_turn_left” action group and delay for 0.2 seconds.

If the center X coordinate of the line differs from the center X coordinate by more than 15, execute the “right_move” action.

If the center X coordinate of the line differs from the center X coordinate by less than -15, execute the 'left_move' action.

If the object's angle is between 3 and 20 degrees, execute the “turn_righ” action group and delay for 0.2 seconds.

If the object's angle is between -5 and -20 degrees, execute the “turn_left” action group and delay for 0.2 seconds.

If the object center’s Y coordinate is between 300 and 420 degrees, execute the “go_forward_one_step” action group and delay for 0.2 seconds.

If the object's center Y coordinate is greater than or equal to 430, it indicates proximity to position, allowing for crossing hurdles or ascending/descending stairs:

Delay for 0.5 seconds

If the object's center Y coordinate is still greater than or equal to 430, activate the buzzer to sound and execute the 'go_forward_one_step' action group to move forward one step, with a delay of 0.5 seconds.

If the value of the 'items' variable is 'hurdles', indicating it is a hurdle type: execute the 'hurdles' action group.

Then set the 'skip_st' and 'strp_up' variables to True. Set the 'items' variable to None.

If the value of the 'items' variable is 'stairway', indicating it is a stairway type:

If the 'strp_up' variable is True, indicating it is an ascending stairs type: execute the 'climb_stairs' action group.

Set the 'strp_up' variable to False. Otherwise, indicating it is a descending stairs type: execute the 'go_forward_one_step' action group to move forward one step.

Delay for 0.2 seconds.

Perform “down_floor” action group.

Set the 'strp_up' variable to True. Set the 'items' variable to None. Set the 'skip_st' variable to True.

Delay for 0.5 seconds.

Set the object’s center Y coordinate to -1.

```py
elif line_st and line_centerx != 8888: #巡线
    if abs(line_centerx - x_center) <= 20:
        AGC.runAction(go_forward)
        time.sleep(0.2)
    elif line_centerx - x_center > 20:
        AGC.runAction(go_turn_right)
        time.sleep(0.2)
    elif line_centerx - x_center < -20:
        AGC.runAction(go_turn_left)
        time.sleep(0.2)

    else:
        time.sleep(0.01)
    else:
        time.sleep(0.01)
```
If the 'line_st' variable is true and the center X coordinate of the line is not equal to 8888, indicating line following:

If the difference between the center X coordinate of the line and the center X coordinate is less than or equal to 20, execute the 'go_forward' action and delay for 0.2 seconds.

If the difference between the center X coordinate of the line and the center X coordinate is greater than 20, execute the 'go_turn_right' action and delay for 0.2 seconds.

If the difference between the center X coordinate of the line and the center X coordinate is less than -20, execute the 'go_turn_left' action and delay for 0.2 seconds.

Otherwise, delay for 0.01 seconds.

* **Modify Climbing and Hurdling Position** 

After the program is started, if the realization effect of going up and down step or hurdling is not good enough, we can change the distance where the robot starts performing action.The program defaults that the robot starts going up and down step or hurdling at a distance of 1000 from the line. If the distance needs to be closer, the data should be decreased; if the distance needs to be farther, the data should be increased.  This  section  takes  robot  starts  climbing  step  or  hurdling  at  a distance of 1020 as example. Please refer to the following steps：

(1) Input “cd /home/pi/TonyPi/Extend/athletics_course/” and press Enter to go to the directory of game program.

```commandline
cd /home/pi/TonyPi/Extend/athletics_course/
```

(2) Enter command “vim athletics_perform.py” and press “ Enter” to open the game programming file.

```commandline
vim athletics_perform.py
```

(3) Find the code framed in the following figure:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/10.ai_autonomous_omnibus/4.1/image8.png"  />

(4) Press "**i**" on keyboard. When "**Insert**" appears in the lower left corner, which means it has entered the editing mode.

```

* **Modify Line Color** 

It is black line on the provided map. After starting program, the robot will walk along the  black  line. You  can  change the  line with  other colored tape, for example, green tape is used to affix on the map and the robot is set to walk along the green line. The specific steps are as follows:

(1) Refer to steps  (1),  (2), (4) in "[9.4.6 Function Extension ->Modify Climbing and Hurdling Position](#anchor_4_5_1)" to enter the program editing interface and find the code framed in the figure below:
