* **Overview of Large Language Model**

A Large Language Model (LLM) is an advanced artificial intelligence model developed to comprehend and generate human language.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_1/01/media/image2.png" class="common_img" />

* **Basic Concept**

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a deep learning model trained on extensive text data, designed to either generate natural language text or comprehend the meaning of language. LLM is capable of performing various natural language tasks, such as text classification, question answering, and dialogue, making them a crucial step toward achieving advanced artificial intelligence. Unlike smaller models, LLM leverages a similar Transformer architecture and pretraining objectives (like Language Modeling), but are distinguished by their larger model size, greater training data, and enhanced computational resources.

* **Features**

**Massive Scale:** LLM are characterized by their vast parameter sizes, often reaching billions or even trillions of parameters. This immense scale allows them to capture a wealth of linguistic knowledge and complex syntactic structures.

**Pretraining and Fine-tuning:** LLM utilize a two-stage learning process: pretraining and fine-tuning. Initially, they are pretrained on large-scale, unlabeled text data, learning general language representations and knowledge. Subsequently, they are fine-tuned using labeled data to specialize in specific tasks, allowing them to excel across a wide range of NLP applications.

**Contextual Awareness:** LLM demonstrate exceptional contextual awareness, with their ability to understand and generate language deeply dependent on preceding text. This enables them to perform exceptionally well in tasks like dialogue, article generation, and contextual comprehension.

**Multilingual Capabilities:** LLM support multiple languages, extending beyond just English. This multilingual proficiency enables them to power cross-lingual and cross-cultural applications, enhancing their versatility and global reach.

**Multimodal Support:** Some LLMs have expanded to handle multimodal data, including text, images, and speech. This capability allows them to understand and generate content across various media types, opening up more diverse application possibilities.

**Emergent Properties:** LLM exhibit remarkable emergent properties, where performance improvements become apparent in large models but are absent in smaller ones. This makes them adept at handling more complex tasks and challenges.

**Cross-domain Applications:** LLM have been widely adopted across numerous fields, including text generation, machine translation, information retrieval, summarization, chatbots, and virtual assistants. Their influence is profound, impacting both daily life and work in significant ways.

**Ethical and Risk Considerations:** While LLM showcase impressive capabilities, they also raise important ethical and risk-related concerns, such as the potential generation of harmful content, privacy violations, and cognitive biases. As such, the development and deployment of LLM must be approached with careful consideration and caution.

* **Working Principle**

Large Language Model (LLM) are built on deep learning principles and are trained using massive datasets and substantial computational resources to develop neural networks with billions of parameters. Through iterative training and parameter optimization, these models learn to perform a wide range of tasks with high accuracy. The **"large"** in LLM reflects their immense scale—encompassing a vast number of parameters, extensive training data, and significant computational demands. This scale enables advanced models to achieve superior generalization capabilities and deliver increasingly accurate results, even in highly specialized domains.

Today, some of the most popular applications revolve around generative AI, such as language generation tools (e.g., ChatGPT) and image generation platforms (e.g., Midjourney). At the core of these applications is the concept of generation—the model's ability to predict and produce coherent content based on a given input.

* **Application Scenarios**

(1) Text Generation

Large Language Models are capable of generating diverse types of text, including news articles, stories, poems, and more. These capabilities make them well-suited for applications in content creation, creative writing, and automated storytelling.

(2) Text Classification

Large Language Models can classify text into various categories, such as sentiment analysis and topic identification. These capabilities are especially valuable in scenarios like public opinion analysis, information retrieval, and content moderation.

(3) Machine Translation

Large Language Models excel at machine translation, enabling the conversion of text from one language to another. These capabilities are essential for cross-language communication, localization, and global collaboration.

(4) Question-Answering Systems

Large Language Models can be used to build question-answering systems that respond to user queries. These applications are particularly valuable in areas such as intelligent customer support, knowledge retrieval, and information lookup.

### 12.1.2 Large Speech Model Courses

* **Overview of Large Speech Model**

(1) What is a Large Speech Model?

A Speech Large Model (LSM) refers to a machine learning model that uses deep learning techniques to process and understand speech data. These models can be applied in a variety of tasks, such as speech recognition, speech synthesis, speech translation, and emotional analysis of speech. The design and training of these models typically require large amounts of speech data and substantial computational resources, which is why they are referred to as **"large models."**

(2) Why Do We Need Large Speech Model?

With the advancement of artificial intelligence and deep learning, traditional speech processing methods face many limitations. Large models leverage vast amounts of data and deep neural networks to learn and understand the complex features within speech, thereby improving the accuracy and naturalness of speech recognition and generation.

Their advantages include:

① High Accuracy: They maintain a high recognition rate even in noisy environments and with various accents.

② Naturalness: Speech generated by synthesis models is more natural, closely resembling human speech.

③ Versatility: These models support a wide range of languages and tasks, such as multilingual speech recognition, speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), and emotion recognition.

(3) Development of Speech Recognition Technology

**Word-Level Speech Recognition:** At this stage, speech recognition systems could only recognize individual words

**Phrase-Level Speech Recognition:** With the expansion of data and advancements in algorithms, speech recognition systems gradually gained the ability to recognize longer phrases, such as **"Please turn on my computer."**

**Sentence-Level Speech Recognition:** In recent years, with the emergence of AI large models, speech recognition systems have become capable of recognizing entire sentences and understanding their underlying meaning.

(4) Differences Between Large Speech Model and Traditional Speech Processing Technologies

**Processing Methods**

Traditional Speech Processing Technologies: These typically rely on manual feature extraction and shallow models, such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM), to process speech signals.

**Large Speech Model:** These use end-to-end learning, directly mapping raw speech waveforms to target outputs (such as text or another speech signal), reducing the reliance on manual feature extraction. They are typically based on deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Transformers.

**Model Complexity**

**Traditional Speech Processing Technologies:** These models are relatively simple, with fewer parameters.

**Large Speech Model:** These models have complex structures and a large number of parameters, enabling them to capture more subtle speech features and contextual information.

**Recognition Capability**

**Traditional Speech Processing Technologies:** These are highly adaptable to specific scenarios and conditions, but their recognition capability is limited when encountering new, unseen data.

**Large Speech Model:** Due to their large number of parameters and powerful learning ability, they offer superior recognition capabilities and can adapt to a wider variety of speech data and environments.

**Training Data Requirements**

**Traditional Speech Processing Technologies:** These typically require less data for training, but the data must be highly annotated and of high quality.

**Large Speech Model:** These require vast amounts of training data to fully learn the complexities of speech, often necessitating large quantities of annotated data or the use of unsupervised/self-supervised learning methods.

(5) Core Technologies of Speech Large Model

**Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**

ASR is the technology that converts human speech into text. The core steps of a speech recognition system include feature extraction, acoustic modeling, and language modeling.

**Text-to-Speech (TTS)**

TTS is the technology that converts text into speech. Common speech synthesis models include the Tacotron series, FastSpeech, and VITS.

**Speech Enhancement and Noise Reduction**

Speech enhancement techniques are used to improve the quality of speech signals, typically for eliminating background noise and echoes. This is crucial for speech recognition applications in noisy environments.

(6) Applications of Speech Large Model

```
vim wakeup_demo.py
```

Press **"i"** to enter edit mode and make the necessary changes as shown below (update the port number accordingly and adjust comments as needed).

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_2/03/media/image4.png" class="common_img" />

Once the changes are complete, press ESC, then type **":wq"** and press Enter to save and exit the editor.

② Next, return to the system interface and run the wake-up demo using the command below. Speak the wake word **"HELLO HIWONDER"** clearly toward the WonderEcho Pro voice device.
If the output includes **"keyword detect"**, it indicates that the firmware has been successfully flashed and the wake word is functioning correctly.

```
python3 ~/large_models/wakeup_demo.py
```

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_2/03/media/image5.png" class="common_img" />

(2) 6-Microphone Circular Array

As with the WonderEcho Pro, you can connect the 6-Microphone Circular Array to your main board (Raspberry Pi or NVIDIA Jetson) using a Type-C to USB cable.

**Device Check**

For Jetson users, connect to the Jetson system using the NoMachine remote access tool. Once connected, check the desktop interface.
If the 6-Microphone Circular Array icon appears on the left side of the desktop, it indicates the device has been successfully recognized.

**Wake-Up Test**

① Open a new terminal window and run the following command to edit the **wakeup_demo.py** script:

```
vim ~/large_models/wakeup_demo.py
```

② Press **"i"** to enter edit mode.

③ Update the port to match the device port number you previously identified. Comment out the WonderEcho Pro configuration (add **"#"** at the beginning of the corresponding line), and uncomment the line using the circular microphone array on line 11 as the input device (see red box in the referenced image).

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_2/03/media/image7.png" class="common_img" />

④ Press ESC to return to command mode, then type **":wq"** and press Enter to save and exit.

⑤ In the terminal, run the wake-up program with the following command:

```
python3 ~/large_models/wakeup_demo.py
```

⑥ After about 30 seconds of initialization, speak the wake word **"hello hiwonder"** to test the device.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_2/03/media/image10.png" class="common_img" />

(3) Brief Program Overview

This is a Python-based wake word detection script that utilizes the **speech** module to process audio input and detect a specific wake word (e.g., **HELLO_HIWONDER**).

Source Code Path: [/home/ubuntu/large_models/wakeup_demo.py]()

**Importing Required Modules**

{lineno-start=5}
```python
import os
import time
from speech import awake
```

① **os**: Used for handling file paths and executing system-level commands.

② **time**: Provides delay functions to prevent overly frequent detection attempts.

③ **speech**: The core module responsible for processing audio input and detecting the wake word.

**Initializing the wonderecho Class**

{lineno-start=9}
```python
port = '/dev/ttyUSB0'
kws = awake.WonderEchoPro(port)
# kws = awake.CircleMic(port)
```

**Attempts to Turn Off the Cooling Fan on Raspberry Pi 5**

{lineno-start=13}
```python
try:  # If a fan is present, it's recommended to turn it off before detection to reduce interference(如果有风扇，检测前推荐关掉减少干扰)
    os.system('pinctrl FAN_PWM op dh')
except:
    pass
```

Purpose: Attempts to turn off the cooling fan by executing the system command `pinctrl FAN_PWM op dh`. This helps minimize background noise from the fan that could interfere with wake word detection.

Error Handling: If the command fails (e.g., due to unsupported hardware), the program catches the exception and continues running without interruption.

**Main Wake Word Detection Loop**

{lineno-start=18}
```python
kws.start() # Start detection(开始检测)
print('start...')
```

The program starts the wake word detection thread using `kws.start()`.

It prints **start...** to indicate that detection has been successfully initiated.

**Main Program Logic**

{lineno-start=21}
```python
while True:
    try:
        if kws.wakeup(): # Wake-up detected(检测到唤醒)
            print('hello hiwonder')
        time.sleep(0.02)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        kws.exit() # Cancel processing (关闭处理)
        try:
            os.system('pinctrl FAN_PWM a0')
        except:
            pass
        break
```

During each iteration, the program checks whether the wake word has been detected. If the wake word is detected, it prints **keyword detected**.

The detection frequency is controlled using `time.sleep(0.02)` to prevent excessive CPU usage.

Pressing Ctrl+C triggers a `KeyboardInterrupt`, which gracefully exits the detection loop.

Upon exit, the program calls `kws.exit()` to stop the wake word detection process.

The fan is then restored to its original state (if applicable).

(4) Extended Functionality

**Modifying the Wake-Up Response Text**

In this section, you'll learn how to change the message that appears after a successful wake word detection.

① For example, if the wake word **"HELLO_HIWONDER"** is detected, and you'd like the program to print **"hello"** instead of the default message, follow the steps below. Navigate to the **large_models** directory and open the script with:

```
vim wakeup_demo.py
```

② Press **"i"** to enter INSERT mode (you'll see -- INSERT -- at the bottom of the screen). Locate the line **print('hello hiwonder')**, and modify it to print('hello').

* **Speech Recognition**

(1) What is Speech Recognition?

Speech Recognition (Speech-to-Text, STT) is a technology that converts human speech signals into text or executable commands. In this course, we will implement speech recognition functionality using Alibaba OpenAI's Speech Recognition API.

(2) How It Works

The **wave** library is used to extract audio data. The extracted audio is then sent to OpenAI's ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model. The recognized text returned by the ASR model is stored in **speech_result** for use in subsequent processes.

(3) Preparation Before the Experiment

Before proceeding, refer to the course [Large Language Models Deployment]() to obtain your API key, and make sure to add it into the configuration file (**config**).

(4) Experiment Steps

[Source Code]()

① Power on the device and connect to it using MobaXterm.
(For detailed instructions, please refer to [Appendix 5.5: Remote Connection Tools and Instructions]().)

② Navigate to the program directory by entering the following command:

```
cd large_models/
```

③ Open the configuration file to input your API Key by entering the command below. Press **"i"** to enter INSERT mode and enter your API Key. Once finished, press Esc, type **":wq"**, and hit Enter to save and exit.

```
vim config.py
```

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_2/04/media/image3.png" class="common_img" />

④ Run the speech recognition program with:

```
python3 openai_asr_demo.py
```

(5) Function Realization

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_2/04/media/image5.png" class="common_img" />

(6) Brief Program Analysis

This program implements a speech recognition system by calling OpenAI's Speech-to-Text API to convert audio files into text.

The program source code is located at: [/home/ubuntu/large_models/openai_asr_demo.py]()

**Module Import**

{lineno-start=5}
```python
from config import *
from speech import speech
```

The **speech** module encapsulates ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) functionalities, such as connecting to an external ASR service.

**Define ASR Class**

{lineno-start=11}
```python
asr = speech.RealTimeOpenAIASR()
# whisper-1 fast than gpt-4o-transcribe 
asr.update_session(model='whisper-1', language='en', threshold=0.2, prefix_padding_ms=300, silence_duration_ms=800)
```

`asr = speech.RealTimeOpenAIASR()`

This line creates a real-time speech recognition object named **asr**. The **RealTimeOpenAIASR** class is used to interact with the speech recognition service.

**Speech Recognition Functionality**

{lineno-start=15}
```python
print('start talking...')
print(asr.asr())
```

An ASR client object is created to prepare for invoking the speech recognition service.

The `asr.asr()` method is called to send the audio file (`wav`) to the ASR service for recognition.

The recognized result (typically text) is printed to the console.

(7) Function Extension

③ Then, run the program with the command:

```
python3 asr_demo.py
```

④ Record a sample sentence such as **"Hello, can you hear me clearly?"**, and the recognized text will be printed on the console.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_2/04/media/image12.png" class="common_img" />

* **Speech Synthesis**

(1) What is Speech Synthesis?

Speech synthesis (SS) is a technology that converts written text into intelligible spoken audio. It enables computers to generate natural, human-like speech for communication or information delivery.

In this course, we will run a program that processes text using a large language model and generates corresponding audio.

(2) How It Works

The program first sends the text to the OpenAI TTS (Text-to-Speech) model. The model returns the generated audio data, which is saved as a file named `tts_audio.wav` for playback or storage.

(3) Preparation Before the Experiment

Refer to the course [Large Language Models Deployment]() to obtain your API key, and update the configuration file accordingly.

(4) Experiment Steps

[Source Code]()

```
cd large_models/
```

③ Open the configuration file to enter your API Key. After editing, press Esc, type **":wq"**, and hit Enter to save and exit:

```
vim config.py
```

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_2/05/media/image3.png" class="common_img" />

④ Finally, run the program with the following command:

```
python3 openai_tts_demo.py
```

(5) Function Realization

Upon running the program, it will play an audio message saying **"Hello, Can I Help You"**, and simultaneously save the audio file with the same content to the following directory:
[/home/ubuntu/large_models/resources/audio/]()

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_2/05/media/image5.png" class="common_img" />

(6) Brief Program Analysis

This program is a speech synthesis system based on OpenAI's Text-to-Speech (TTS) API, capable of converting text into audio files. It supports input text and outputs audio in formats like PCM, WAV, FLAC, AAC, Opus, and MP3. By specifying the desired text, the program sends the request to the API and returns the synthesized audio, which can be played or saved locally.

The source code for this program is located at:
[/home/ubuntu/large_models/openai_tts_demo.py]()

**Module Import**

{lineno-start=5}
```python
from config import *
from speech import speech   
```

① **speech**: This module encapsulates the TTS functionalities.

**Definition for TTS Class**

{lineno-start=8}
```python
tts = speech.RealTimeOpenAITTS()
tts.tts("Hello, Can I help you?") # https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech
tts.tts("Hello, Can I help you?", model="tts-1", voice="onyx", speed=1.0, instructions='Speak in a cheerful and positive tone.')
tts.save_audio("Hello, Can I help you?", model="gpt-4o-mini-tts", voice="onyx", speed=1.0, instructions='Speak in a cheerful and positive tone.', audio_format='wav', save_path="./resources/audio/tts_audio.wav")
```

① `speed`: Specifies the playback speed; the default value is 1.

For intelligent real-time applications, it is recommended to use the **gpt-4o-mini-tts** model.
Other available models include **tts-1** and **tts-1-hd**. **tts-1** offers lower latency but with slightly reduced quality compared to **tts-1-hd**.

Voice Options: nova, shimmer, echo, onyx, fable, alloy, ash, sage, coral.

```
vim openai_tts_demo.py
```

② Press **"i"** on your keyboard to enter INSERT mode. Locate the line **voice="onyx"** and modify it to **voice="nova".**

```
i
```

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_2/05/media/image10.png" class="common_img" />

③ Press Esc, then type **":wq"** and hit Enter to save and exit.

```
:wq
```

④ Execute the program with the following command:

```
python3 openai_tts_demo.py
```

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_2/05/media/image12.png" class="common_img" />

Once the program starts, the speaker will play the synthesized audio using the newly selected voice style.

* **Voice Interaction**

(1) What is Voice Interaction?

Voice Interaction (VI) refers to a method of communication between humans and computers or devices through spoken language. It integrates speech recognition and speech synthesis, enabling devices to both understand user commands and respond naturally, creating true two-way voice communication. To achieve natural voice interaction, factors such as semantic understanding and sentiment analysis must also be considered, allowing the system to accurately interpret user intent and provide appropriate responses.

This approach can be used as the foundation for developing our own AI assistant features.

(2) How It Works

First, the wake word detection module listens for a specific wake-up word. Once detected, it initiates audio recording. After recording, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) converts the audio into text, which is then sent to a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate an appropriate response. The generated text is subsequently converted into speech through a Text-to-Speech (TTS) module and played back to the user. This entire process enables seamless and natural interaction between the user and the voice assistant.

(3) Experiment Steps

[Source Code]()

① Power on the device and connect to it via MobaXterm.

② To check the microphone's port number, first disconnect the microphone and run the command. Then reconnect the microphone and run the command again to determine the port number 

:::{Note}

```
python3 openai_interaciton_demo.py
```

⑦ To stop the program at any time, simply press Ctrl+C.

(4) Function Realization

After successful execution, the voice device will announce **'I'm ready.'** Then, upon hearing the wake-up word **'HELLO_HIWONDER,'** the device will respond with **'I'm here,'** indicating that the assistant has been successfully awakened. You can now ask the AI assistant any questions:

For example: **'What are some fun places to visit in New York?'**

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_2/06/media/image7.png" class="common_img" />

(5) Brief Program Analysis

The program integrates voice recognition, speech synthesis, and intelligent response functionalities to create a voice assistant. Interaction is initiated through the wake-up word (**HELLO_HIWONDER**). Users can converse with the assistant via voice commands, and the assistant will respond using text-to-speech technology. The overall structure is clear, with distinct modules that are easy to expand and maintain.

The source code for this program is located at: [/home/ubuntu/large_models/openai_interaction_demo.py]()

**Module Import**

{lineno-start=5}
```python
import os
import time
from config import *
from speech import awake
from speech import speech
```

① **time**: Used to control the interval between program executions.

② **speech**: The core module, integrating wake-up word detection, speech activity detection, speech recognition, TTS, and LLM.

**Definition of Audio File Paths**

{lineno-start=9}
```python
wakeup_audio_path = './resources/audio/en/wakeup.wav'
start_audio_path = './resources/audio/en/start_audio.wav'
no_voice_audio_path = './resources/audio/en/no_voice.wav'

port = '/dev/ttyUSB0'
kws = awake.WonderEchoPro(port)
# kws = awake.CircleMic(port)

asr = speech.RealTimeOpenAIASR()
asr.update_session(model='whisper-1')
tts = speech.RealTimeOpenAITTS()
client = speech.OpenAIAPI(llm_api_key, llm_base_url)
```

This section configures the audio file paths used by various functional modules, such as wake-up sounds, recording storage paths, and prompt sounds.

The text-to-speech (TTS) module is initialized to convert LLM responses into speech.

**Main Functional Logic**

{lineno-start=33}
```python
def main():
    kws.start()
    while True:
        try:
            if kws.wakeup(): # Wake word detected(检测到唤醒词)
                speech.play_audio(wakeup_audio_path)  # Play wake-up sound(唤醒播放)
                asr_result = asr.asr() # Start voice recognition(开启录音识别)
                print('asr_result:', asr_result)
                if asr_result:
                    # Send the recognition result to the agent for a response(将识别结果传给智能体让他来回答)
                    response = client.llm(asr_result, model='gpt-4o-mini')
                    print('llm response:', response)
                    tts.tts(response)
                else:
                    speech.play_audio(no_voice_audio_path)
            time.sleep(0.02)
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            kws.exit() 
            try:
                os.system('pinctrl FAN_PWM a0')
            except:
                pass
            break
        except BaseException as e:
            print(e)
```

Wake-up Detection: Continuously monitors for the wake-up word. Once detected, it stops the wake-up detection and plays the wake-up prompt sound.

Voice Processing: Records and recognizes the user's speech, uses the language model to generate a response, and then converts the response into speech for playback.

Error Handling: Catches exit signals and runtime errors to ensure the program exits safely and releases resources.

### 12.1.3 Vision Language Model Courses

* **Overview of Vision Language Model**

Vision Language Model (VLM) integrate visual recognition capabilities into traditional Language Model (LLM), enabling more powerful interactions between vision and language through multimodal inputs.

(1) Basic Concept

Vision Language Model (VLM) are a type of artificial intelligence model that leverages deep learning techniques to learn from and process large-scale visual data. These models often adopt convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, enabling them to extract rich visual features from images or video streams and perform various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and facial recognition. In theory, VLM possess powerful capabilities in feature extraction and pattern recognition, making them widely applicable in fields like autonomous driving, facial recognition, and medical imaging analysis.

(2) Features

**Multimodal Input and Output**: VLM can process both images and text as input and generate various forms of output, including text, images, charts, and more.

**Powerful Visual-Semantic Understanding**: With extensive knowledge accumulated from large-scale visual datasets, VLMs excel at tasks such as object detection, classification, and image captioning.

**Visual Question Answering (VQA):** VLM can engage in natural language conversations based on the content of input images, accurately answering vision-related questions.

**Image Generation:** Some advanced VLM are capable of generating simple image content based on given conditions.

**Deep Visual Understanding:** These models can recognize intricate details within images and explain underlying logical and causal relationships.

**Cross-Modal Reasoning:** VLM can leverage visual and linguistic information together, enabling reasoning across modalities, such as inferring from language to vision and vice versa.

**Unified Visual and Language Representation Space:** By applying attention mechanisms, VLM establish deep connections between visual and semantic information, achieving unified multimodal representations.

**Open Knowledge Integration:** VLM can integrate both structured and unstructured knowledge, enhancing their understanding of image content.

(3) How It Works

The working principle of Vision Language Model is primarily based on deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer architectures. Through multiple layers of neurons, these models perform feature extraction and information processing, enabling them to automatically recognize and understand complex patterns within images.

In a VLM, the input image first passes through several convolutional layers, where local features such as edges, textures, and shapes are extracted. Each convolutional layer is typically followed by an activation function (e.g., ReLU) to introduce non-linearity, allowing the model to learn more complex representations. Pooling layers are often used to reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving important information, helping to optimize computational efficiency.

As the network deepens, it gradually transitions from extracting low-level features (like edges and corners) to higher-level features (such as objects and scenes). For classification tasks, the final feature vector is passed through fully connected layers to predict the probability of different target categories. For tasks like object detection and segmentation, the model outputs bounding boxes or masks to indicate the location and shape of objects within the image.

Transformer-based VLM divide images into small patches, treating them as sequential data, and apply self-attention mechanisms to capture global relationships within the image. This approach is particularly effective at modeling long-range dependencies, enabling VLM to excel at understanding complex visual scenes.

Training VLM typically requires large-scale labeled datasets. Through backpropagation, the model optimizes its parameters to minimize the loss between predictions and ground-truth labels. Pretraining on massive datasets allows the model to acquire general-purpose visual features, while fine-tuning on specific tasks further improves performance for specialized applications.

Thanks to this design, Visual Language Models are able to process and understand visual data effectively, and are widely used in applications like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation, driving rapid progress in the field of computer vision.

(4) Application Scenarios

**Image Captioning**

VLM can automatically generate textual descriptions based on input images. This capability is particularly valuable for social media platforms, e-commerce websites, and accessibility technologies, such as providing visual content descriptions for visually impaired users.

**Visual Question Answering**

Users can ask questions related to an image, such as **"What is in this picture?"** or **"What color is the car?"** The model analyzes the image content and provides accurate, natural-language responses, making it highly applicable in fields such as education, customer support, and information services.

**Image Retrieval**

In image search engines, users can perform searches using text descriptions, and Vision Language Model (VLM) can understand the descriptions and return relevant images. This capability is especially important on e-commerce platforms, where it allows users to find desired products more intuitively.

**Augmented Reality (AR)**

Vision Language Model (VLM) can provide real-time visual feedback and language-based explanations in augmented reality applications. When users view real-world scenes through a device's camera, the system can overlay relevant information or guidance, enhancing the overall user experience.

**Content Creation and Editing**

In design and creative tools, Vision Language Model (VLM) can generate relevant text content or suggestions based on a user's visual input (such as sketches or images), helping users complete creative work more efficiently.

**Social Media Interaction**

On social media platforms, VLM can generate appropriate comments or tags based on user-uploaded images, enhancing engagement and interaction.

**Medical Imaging Analysis**

In the healthcare field, VLM can be used to analyze medical images (such as X-rays and CT scans) and generate diagnostic reports or recommendations, assisting doctors in making more accurate decisions.

### 12.1.4 Multimodal Model Basic Courses

* **Overview of Multimodal Model**

The emergence of Multimodal Model is built upon continuous advancements in the fields of Large Language Model (LLM) and Vision Language Model (VLM).

(1) Basic Concept

As LLM continue to improve in language understanding and reasoning capabilities, techniques such as instruction tuning, in-context learning, and chain-of-thought prompting have become increasingly widespread. However, despite their strong performance on language tasks, LLM still exhibit notable limitations in perceiving and understanding visual information such as images. At the same time, VLM have made significant strides in visual tasks such as image segmentation and object detection, and can now be guided by language instructions to perform these tasks, though their reasoning abilities still require further enhancement.

(2) Features

The core strength of Multimodal Model lies in their ability to understand and manipulate visual content through language instructions. Through pretraining and fine-tuning, these models learn the associations between different modalities—such as how to generate descriptions from images or how to identify and classify objects in visual data. Leveraging self-attention mechanisms from deep learning, Multimodal Model can effectively capture relationships across modalities, allowing them to synthesize information from multiple sources during reasoning and decision-making processes.

**Multimodal Fusion Capability:** Multimodal Model can process and understand multiple types of data simultaneously, including text, images, and audio. This fusion ability enables the models to build connections across modalities, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of information. For instance, a model can generate natural language descriptions based on an image or identify specific objects within an image based on a text query.

**Enhanced Contextual Understanding:** By integrating information from different modalities, Multimodal Model excel at contextual understanding. They can not only recognize content within a single modality but also combine clues from multiple sources to make more accurate judgments and decisions in complex tasks.

**Flexible Interaction Methods:** Users can interact with Multimodal Model through natural language instructions, making communication with the models more intuitive without requiring knowledge of complex programming or operations. For example, users can simply ask about details in an image, and the model can provide relevant answers.

**Scalability:** The architecture and training methods of Multimodal Model allow them to adapt to new modalities and tasks. As technology evolves, additional types of data—such as videos or sensor readings—can be incorporated, expanding their range of applications and capabilities.

**Strong Generative Capabilities:** Similar to large language models, Multimodal Model perform exceptionally well in generating both textual and visual content. They can produce natural language descriptions, summaries, and even create novel visual outputs, meeting a wide variety of application needs.

**Improved Reasoning Abilities:** Although challenges remain, Multimodal Model demonstrate significantly enhanced reasoning capabilities compared to traditional single-modality models. By integrating multimodal information, they can reason effectively in more complex scenarios, supporting advanced tasks such as logical reasoning and sentiment analysis.

**Adaptability and Personalization:** Multimodal Model can be fine-tuned to meet user-specific needs and preferences, enabling highly personalized services. This adaptability offers great potential for applications in fields such as education, entertainment, and customer service.

(3) How It Works

The working principle of Multimodal Model is built upon advanced deep learning and neural network technologies, with a core focus on fusing data from different modalities to understand and tackle complex tasks. At the foundation, Multimodal Model often adopt architectures similar to Transformers, which are highly effective at capturing relationships between different parts of input data. During training, these models are exposed to massive amounts of multimodal data—such as images, text, and audio—and leverage large-scale unsupervised learning for pretraining. Through this process, the models learn the commonalities and differences across modalities, enabling them to grasp the intrinsic connections between various types of information.

In practice, incoming text and visual data are first embedded into a shared representation space. Text inputs are transformed into vectors using word embedding techniques, while images are processed through methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract visual features. These vectors are then fed into the model's encoder, where self-attention mechanisms analyze the relationships across modalities, identifying and focusing on the most relevant information.

After encoding, the model generates a multimodal contextual representation that blends both the semantic information of the text and the visual features of the image. When a user provides a natural language instruction, the MLLM parses the input and interprets the intent by leveraging the contextual representation. This process involves reasoning and generation capabilities, allowing the model to produce appropriate responses based on its learned knowledge, or to perform specific actions in visual tasks.

Finally, the Multimodal Model's decoder translates the processed information into outputs that users can easily understand—such as generating textual descriptions or executing targeted visual operations. Throughout this process, the emphasis is on the fusion and interaction of information across different modalities, enabling Multimodal Model to excel at handling complex combinations of natural language and visual content. This integrated working mechanism empowers Multimodal Model with powerful functionality and flexibility across a wide range of application scenarios.

(4) Application Scenarios

**Education**

Multimodal Model can be used to create personalized learning experiences. By combining text and visual content, the model can provide students with rich learning materials—for example, explaining scientific concepts through a mix of images and text to enhance understanding. Additionally, in online courses, the model can dynamically adjust content based on the learner's performance, offering customized learning suggestions in real time.

**Healthcare**

Multimodal Model can assist doctors in diagnosis and treatment decisions. By analyzing medical images (such as X-rays or MRIs) alongside relevant medical literature, the model helps doctors access information more quickly and provides evidence-based recommendations. This application improves diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

**Entertainment**

Multimodal Model can be used for content generation, such as automatically creating stories, scripts, or in-game dialogues. By incorporating visual elements, the model can provide rich scene descriptions for game developers, enhancing immersion. Additionally, on social media platforms, Multimodal Model can analyze user-generated images and text to help recommend suitable content.

**Advertising and Marketing**

Multimodal Model can analyze consumer behavior and preferences to generate personalized advertising content. By combining text and images, ads can better capture the attention of target audiences and improve conversion rates.

Finally, Multimodal Model also play a role in scientific research. By processing large volumes of literature and image data, the model can help researchers identify trends, generate hypotheses, or summarize findings, accelerating scientific discovery.

* **How It Works**

Once the feature is activated, you can issue commands in your own words, such as **"kick the red ball ahead,"** to control TonyPi. It will automatically track any ball within its line of sight and perform the kicking action.

* **Function Expansion**

(1) Changing the Color of the Tracked Ball

① By default, the program is set to track a red ball. It includes preset color thresholds for red, green, blue, black, and white. You can modify the commands as needed to control TonyPi to track balls of different colors.

② For example, to track a blue ball, follow the steps and then issue the command, **"kick the blue ball ahead."** (Feel free to rephrase the command in your own way, as long as the meaning remains the same.)

Here is a terminal screenshot of the entire voice interaction process.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_5/03/media/image12.png" class="common_img" />

:::{Note}
When issuing commands, describe the color of the tracked ball in a straightforward manner without adding unnecessary modifiers. For example, when tracking a blue ball, simply use the term **"blue"** rather than descriptors like **"sky blue"** or **"lake blue."** Using such modifiers could confuse the model, leading to incorrect parameters in the action functions and causing the program to fail in tracking the ball due to the inability to find the correct color configuration.
:::

(2) Change Action

① The large language model supports chaining multiple actions into a single command. You can refer to the table below to combine the ball-tracking and kicking function with the actions introduced in the previous section.

② Here's an example of a multi-action command:
Follow the tutorial steps accordingly. When prompted, you may say:
**"Take two steps forward, kick the blue ball, then bow."** (Feel free to rephrase the command in your own way, as long as the meaning remains the same.)

Here is a terminal screenshot of the entire voice interaction process.

### 12.2.4 Multimodal Model: Autonomous Cruise

* **Brief Game Instructions**

This feature allows TonyPi to navigate autonomously. In cruise mode, it recognizes different colors and performs corresponding actions such as line following, step climbing, and hurdle crossing.

Once the program starts running and WonderEcho Pro announces **"I am ready."**

Say the wake-up word (the wake-up word depends on the firmware flashed, and by default, the wake-up word for our factory firmware is **"Hello, HiWonder"**) to activate WonderEcho Pro. It will respond with **"I am here."**

You can then control TonyPi using voice commands. For example, saying **"Start athletics performance"** will prompt WonderEcho Pro to announce the response generated after processing and execute the corresponding action.

* **Preparation**

(1) Verifying the WonderEcho Pro Firmware

By default, the wake-up word for the WonderEcho Pro factory firmware is **"Hello, HiWonder."** If you wish to change the wake-up word to **"TonyPi,"** please refer to the tutorial titled [6 AI Voice Interaction Course → 6.1 Introduction to WonderEcho Pro and Installation → 6.1.3 Firmware Flashing Method]() for step-by-step instructions.

(2) Obtaining and Configuring the Large Model API Key

By default, the program does not include the configuration of the Large AI Model-related API keys. Before activating features related to the Large AI Model, please refer to the section [12.2.1 Obtaining and Configuring Large Model API Keys]() to configure the necessary keys. This step is mandatory and cannot be skipped, as it is crucial for the proper functioning and experience of the large model features.

(3) Network Configuration

The robot must be connected to the internet, either in STA (local network) mode or AP (direct connection) mode via Ethernet. For detailed instructions on network configuration, please refer to the course [14. Robot Network Configuration]() .

* **Starting and Stopping the Game**

:::{Note}
* The input commands must strictly observe case sensitivity and spacing.
* The robot must be connected to the internet, either in STA (local network) mode or AP (direct connection) mode via Ethernet.
:::

[Source Code]()

(1) Power on the robot and remotely connect to the Raspberry Pi desktop via VNC.

(2) Double-click the **"Terminator"** icon <img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_5/04/media/image2.png" /> on the Raspberry Pi desktop to open the command-line terminal.

(3) Execute the following command to disable the app auto-start service.

```
sudo systemctl stop tonypi.service
```

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_5/04/media/image3.png" class="common_img" />

(4) Enter the command and press the Enter key to navigate to the directory where the game program is stored:

```
cd embodied_intelligence/multimodal_large_models_course
```

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_5/04/media/image4.png" class="common_img" />

(5) Enter the command and press the Enter key to start the game:

```
python3 main.py
```

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_5/04/media/image5.png" class="common_img" />

(6) When the following output appears in the command line, it indicates that WonderEcho Pro has completed initialization and will announce **"I am ready."** At this point, you can say the wake word, **"hello hiwonder."**

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_5/04/media/image6.png" class="common_img" />

(7) When the following output appears in the command line, WonderEcho Pro will announce **"I am Here,"** indicating that WonderEcho Pro has been successfully activated. At this point, the system will begin recording the user's command.

You can freely organize your language and issue commands to control TonyPi to start tracking and kicking the ball, such as **"Start athletics performance."**

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_5/04/media/image7.png" class="common_img" />

(8) When the command line shows the output below, it indicates that the cloud-based voice large model's speech recognition service has successfully processed the user's command audio. The recognition result will be displayed under `asr_result`.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_5/04/media/image8.png" class="common_img" />

(9) When the terminal displays the following output, it means the Raspberry Pi has successfully accessed the cloud-based large language model, processed the user's command, generated a spoken response, and created a corresponding action group based on the command's intent.

At this point, the robot will execute the actions outlined in the `action` sequence.

:::{Note}
* The response is automatically generated by the large model, ensuring the accuracy of the meaning, though the wording and structure of the reply may vary.
* Once the Autonomous Cruise mode is activated, the program will continue running this function. To stop it, press Ctrl+C in the terminal.
:::

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_5/04/media/image9.png" class="common_img" />

```

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_5/04/media/image10.png" class="common_img" />

* **How It Works**

Once the mode is activated, you can give commands such as **"Start athletics performance"** to control TonyPi in Autonomous Cruise mode. In this mode, TonyPi will follow a black line, climb steps when it detects a red line, and hurdle over blue obstacles.

* **Function Expansion**

(1) Change the Triggered Color

① In the Autonomous Cruise mode, three behaviors are pre-set: line following, hurdling, and step climbing. The program also includes predefined color thresholds for red, green, blue, black, and white. You can modify the program to control TonyPi to follow lines other than black, or to trigger the step climbing action when detecting lines other than red, or activate the hurdling action when encountering objects that are not blue.

② Double-click the **"Terminator"** icon <img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_5/04/media/image2.png" /> on the Raspberry Pi desktop to open the command-line terminal.

③ Enter the command and press the Enter key to navigate to the directory where the game program is stored:

```
cd embodied_intelligence/multimodal_large_models_course
```

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_5/04/media/image11.png" class="common_img" />

④ Run the following command to open the program file:

```
vim functions/athletics_perform.py
```

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_5/04/media/image12.png" class="common_img" />

⑤ The program includes preset color thresholds for red, green, blue, black, and white (i.e., `red`, `green`, `blue`, `black`, `white`).

If you want to change the line-following color, please locate the section of code marked as ① in the image below and modify the corresponding values.

To change the color used for hurdle-crossing detection, refer to the code marked as ②.

To modify the color used for stair-climbing detection, edit the code at position ③.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_5/04/media/image13.png" class="common_img" />

⑥ Below is a screenshot example showing how to configure the robot to:

Follow white lines for autonomous navigation,

Perform hurdle-crossing when encountering green obstacles, and

Execute stair-climbing when detecting blue lines.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_5/04/media/image14.png" class="common_img" />

⑦ After making the changes, press the **"Esc"** key on your keyboard and enter the following command to save and exit:

```
:wq
```

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_5/04/media/image15.png" class="common_img" />

⑧ Enter the command and press the Enter key to start the game:

```
python3 main.py
```

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_5/04/media/image16.png" class="common_img" />

(2) Change Action

① The large model supports chaining multiple actions in sequence. You may refer to the table below to combine the TonyPi executable actions covered in the previous section with the **"Autonomous Cruise"** function.

② The following is an example of chaining actions before and after autonomous cruise. Execute the actions in the specified sequence. During the autonomous navigation phase, you can issue the command:
**"Please step back and start the athletic performance."** (Feel free to rephrase the command in your own way, as long as the meaning remains the same.)

## 12.3 Embodied AI Applications

### 12.3.1 Embodied AI Applications in Real-Time Detection

* **Brief Game Instructions**

KWS (Keyword Spotting) is used to detect whether the user has spoken a specific wake word. By integrating KWS with ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition), the system enables more comprehensive speech recognition capabilities.

Once the wake word is detected, ASR processes the audio signal and converts it into text. After detecting the wake word, the system records the user's voice for further recognition.

Upon recognizing the speech, the system retrieves an image from the image queue and passes both the recognition result and the image to the agent for response generation.

Finally, TTS (Text-to-Speech) converts the agent's generated text into speech, saving it as an audio file for playback.

* **Preparation**

(1) Verifying the WonderEcho Pro Firmware

By default, the wake-up word for the WonderEcho Pro factory firmware is **"Hello, HiWonder."** If you wish to change the wake-up word to **"TonyPi,"** please refer to the tutorial titled [6 AI Voice Interaction Course → 6.1 Introduction to WonderEcho Pro and Installation → 6.1.3 Firmware Flashing Method]() for step-by-step instructions.

(2) Obtaining and Configuring the Large Model API Key

By default, the program does not include the configuration of the Large AI Model-related API keys. Before activating features related to the Large AI Model, please refer to the section [12.2.1 Obtaining and Configuring Large Model API Keys]() to configure the necessary keys. This step is mandatory and cannot be skipped, as it is crucial for the proper functioning and experience of the large model features.

(3) Network Configuration

The robot must be connected to the internet, either in STA (local network) mode or AP (direct connection) mode via Ethernet. For detailed instructions on network configuration, please refer to the course [14. Robot Network Configuration]() .

```
sudo systemctl restart tonypi.service
```

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_6/01/media/image8.png" class="common_img" />

* **How It Works**

Once successfully awakened, the robot will announce, **"I am Here."** You can then give the command, **"Describe what you saw."** The robot will analyze the current image feed, detect the content, and display the text on the terminal while also announcing it via voice.

:::{Note}
If no command is given after awakening, the robot will respond with, **"Sorry, would you please repeat again."** Once a command is issued, the recognized sentence will appear on the terminal, allowing you to confirm that the robot has received the instruction.

* **Brief Program Analysis**

The configuration file for this program is located at: [`/home/pi/embodied_intelligence/embodied_intelligence_course/vllm_with_camera.py`]()

**Feature Package Import**

```python
import os, sys
sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..')))
import cv2
import time
import queue
import action
import threading
from common.config import *
from speech import speech
from speech import awake
```

① `os`: System-related operations.

② `time`: Controls delay functions.

③ `config`: Configuration files.

④ **speech**: Modules for large model speech interaction.

**Wake Word Detection**

{lineno-start=46}
```python
def vllm_thread():
    pid = None
    kws.start()
    while running:
        if kws.wakeup(): # Wake word has been detected (检测到唤醒词)
            speech.play_audio(wakeup_audio_path)  # Play wake-up audio (唤醒播放)
            asr_result = asr.asr()  # Start recording and speech recognition (开启录音识别)
            print('asr_result:', asr_result)
```

The functions are as follows:

`if kws.wakeup()`: Detects whether the wake word has been triggered. The wake word serves as the key trigger that transitions the device from sleep mode to a state where it is waiting for user commands.

`speech.play_audio(wakeup_audio_path)`: Plays the wake-up audio file, signaling to the user that the device is now in standby mode.

**Recording and Recognition**

`asr_result = asr.asr()`: Proceeds to the next step if the audio is successfully recorded and recognized.

`print('asr_result:', asr_result)`: Outputs the recognized speech result to the terminal.

`asr_result = client.vllm(asr_result, image, prompt='', model=vllm_model)`: Sends the recognized text and image to the agent for processing.

**Action Handling**

{lineno-start=56}
```python
if asr_result:
    image = image_queue.get(block=True) 
    # Pass the recognition result to the agent for it to generate a response (将识别结果传给智能体让他来回答)

### 12.3.2 Embodied AI Applications in Smart Home Assistant

* **Brief Game Instructions**

KWS (Keyword Spotting) is used to detect whether the user has spoken a specific wake word. By integrating KWS with ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition), the system enables more comprehensive speech recognition capabilities.

Once the wake word is detected, ASR processes the audio signal and converts it into text. After detecting the wake word, the system records the user's voice for further recognition.

Upon recognizing the speech, the system retrieves an image from the image queue and passes both the recognition result and the image to the agent for response generation.

Finally, TTS (Text-to-Speech) converts the agent's generated text into speech, saving it as an audio file for playback.

* **Preparation**

(1) Verifying the WonderEcho Pro Firmware

By default, the wake-up word for the WonderEcho Pro factory firmware is **"Hello, HiWonder."** If you wish to change the wake-up word to **"TonyPi,"** please refer to the tutorial titled [6 AI Voice Interaction Course → 6.1 Introduction to WonderEcho Pro and Installation → 6.1.3 Firmware Flashing Method]() for step-by-step instructions.

(2) Obtaining and Configuring the Large Model API Key

By default, the program does not include the configuration of the Large AI Model-related API keys. Before activating features related to the Large AI Model, please refer to the section [12.2.1 Obtaining and Configuring Large Model API Keys]() to configure the necessary keys. This step is mandatory and cannot be skipped, as it is crucial for the proper functioning and experience of the large model features.

(3) Network Configuration

The robot must be connected to the internet, either in STA (local network) mode or AP (direct connection) mode via Ethernet. For detailed instructions on network configuration, please refer to the course [14. Robot Network Configuration]() .

```
cd embodied_intelligence/embodied_intelligence_course
```

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_6/02/media/image4.png" class="common_img" />

(3) Then, input the command to start the game:

```
python3 vllm_dietitianl.py
```

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_6/02/media/image5.png" class="common_img" />

(4) When the terminal displays the following output, the program has successfully started.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_6/02/media/image6.png" class="common_img" />

(5) Once running, say the wake word **"hello hiwonder"** to activate the large model, and the robot will respond with the message, **"I am Here."**

(6) At this stage, you can speak to the robot with a command like:
**"I want to get some red fruits. Could you give me some suggestions?"**

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_6/02/media/image7.png" class="common_img" />

(7) Upon successfully recognizing the command, the terminal will display the corresponding text, and the robot will announce it via voice.

```

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_12/section_6/02/media/image9.png" class="common_img" />

* **How It Works**

Once successfully awakened, TonyPi responds to your commands instantly—not only with clear voice feedback, but also by performing corresponding actions in real time. For example, if you say, **"I want to get some red fruits. Could you give me some suggestions?"**, TonyPi will reply, **"You can have the apple on the right, it's red,"** while simultaneously raising its right arm to point at the apple.

    asr_result = asr.asr()  # Start recording and speech recognition（开启录音识别）
    print('asr_result:', asr_result)
```

The meaning of the functions is as follows:

① `if kws.wakeup()`: Detects whether the wake word has been triggered. The wake word serves as the key trigger that transitions the device from sleep mode to a state where it is waiting for user commands.

② `speech.play_audio(wakeup_audio_path)`: Plays the wake-up audio file, signaling to the user that the device is now in standby mode.

③ `asr_result = asr.asr()`: Starts recording and transcribes the audio input.

**Recording and Recognition**

① `if asr_result`: If audio content is successfully recognized, proceed to large model processing.

② `if language == 'Chinese'`: If the system language is set to Chinese, it will use Chinese large language model for processing; otherwise, it will default to the OpenAI model.

③ `result = client.llm_origin(params).choices[0].message.content.strip()`: Invokes the `llm_origin` method with the specified `params` to obtain an initial response, which is then stored in the `result` variable for further handling.

**Speech Processing and Synthesis**

{lineno-start=162}
```python
if 'action' in result:  # If a corresponding action is returned, extract and handle it（如果有对应的行为返回那么就提取处理）

    if 'response' in result:
        response = result['response']
else:  # If there's no corresponding action, just reply with the answer(没有对应的行为，只回答)
    response = result
```

`result = eval(result[result.find('{'):result.find('}') + 1])`:
Uses the `eval` function to parse the JSON-formatted string and extract the action and response elements.

**Actions**

If `action_list` is not empty, it indicates that there are actions to be performed. If `response` is not empty, the system first converts the response text to speech using Text-to-Speech (TTS) for audio feedback. The system then iterates over the `action_list`, executing each action by calling the corresponding function and processing the result.

**Recalling the Agent**

If the action returns a non-empty result, the agent is called again to retrieve feedback related to the action. The result is then parsed to extract the actions and response.

**Action Execution and Feedback**

{lineno-start=191}
```python
if actions:
    for a in actions:
        eval(f'action.{a}')
else:
    if response != '':
        tts.tts(response)
    else:
        speech.play_audio(error_audio_path)
```

If new actions are extracted, iterate through and execute each one. If no new actions are found, play the feedback based on the response, or play an error sound if the response is invalid.

# 角色任务
作为具身智能运输机器人，你的任务是按照指定的规则和操作方法搬运物体。你需要根据物
体的相对位置决定搬运顺序，并遵循一系列的搬运逻辑和操作步骤。

## 理解相对位置：
你需要理解物体之间的相对位置关系，包括上下、左右，旁边等。

## 搬运逻辑和操作步骤：
1. 在执行搬运任务前，确认物体的相对位置，确保搬运顺序和操作符合实际情况。
2. 根据物体的位置关系，决定搬运顺序。如果目标物体在其他物体下面，需要先搬起上面的物放到一旁，再搬运目标物体。
3. 如果目标物体位于其他物体的上方或旁边，可以直接搬运。
4. 如果直接要求放置位置，而且前面没有搬起过物体，那么要先要搬起物体
5. 在放置物体时，需要遵循指定的方位（如上方、左边、右边，旁边）。

## 可用函数与操作：
* 搬起目标物体：pick_up('red')
* 搬起在其他物体上面的目标物体：pick_up_on('red')
* 将目标物体放到随机位置或旁边：place_random()
* 将目标物体放置到指定物体的指定方位：place_on('blue', 'left')

**Role
You are an embodied intelligent transportation robot. Your task is to move objects based on specific rules and procedures. You must determine the order of operations according to the relative positions of the objects and follow a series of handling logic and action steps.

**Understanding Relative Positions:
You need to understand spatial relationships between objects, including terms like above, below, left of, right of, and next to.

**Transport Logic and Action Steps:
1 Before executing any task, identify the relative positions of all objects to ensure the sequence of operations matches the actual layout.
2 If the target object is beneath another object, you must first move the object(s) on top to another location before handling the target object.
3 If the target object is on top of or beside another object, you may proceed to move it directly.
4 If you're directly instructed to place an object somewhere without first picking anything up, you must pick it up first.
5 When placing objects, always follow the specified direction (e.g., top, left, right).

**Available Functions:
Pick up a target object: pick_up('red')
Pick up a target object that is on top of another object: pick_up_on('red')
Place the object in a random or adjacent location: place_random()
Place the object in a specified direction relative to another object: place_on('blue', 'left')

**Example:
Task: Put down the green sponge.
Response: {"action": ["place_random()"], "response": "Let's move the green sponge somewhere else."}

Task: Place the green sponge to the right of the red sponge.
Response: {"action": ["pick_up('green')","place_on('red', 'right')"], "response": "Got a task, let's go!"}

Task: The red sponge is on top of the green sponge. Move the green sponge to the left of the red sponge.
Response: {"action": ["pick_up_on('red')", "place_random()", "pick_up('green')", "place_on('red', 'left')"], "response": "Got a task, let's go!"}

Task: The red sponge is on top of the green sponge. Move the red sponge to the right of the green sponge.
Response: {"action": ["pick_up_on('red')", "place_on('green', 'right')"], "response": "Watch me work!"}

Task: The green sponge is on top of the red sponge. Move the green sponge to the left of the red sponge.
Response: {"action": ["pick_up_on('green')", "place_on('red', 'left')"], "response": "That's easy for me!"}

Task: The green sponge is on top of the red sponge. Move the green sponge to the right of the red sponge.
Response: {"action": ["pick_up_on('green')", "place_on('red', 'right')"], "response": "That's easy for me!"}

Task: The green sponge is to the left of the red sponge. Move the red sponge on top of the green sponge.
Response: {"action": ["pick_up('red')", "place_on('green', 'top')"], "response": "Red sponge, let's fly up to the green sponge!"}

Task: The red sponge is to the right of the green sponge. Move the green sponge on top of the red sponge.
Response: {"action": ["pick_up('green')", "place_on('red', 'top')"], "response": "Starting the mission, green sponge on top of red!"}

Task: The red sponge is on top of the green sponge. Move the green sponge on top of the red sponge.
Response: {"action": ["pick_up_on('red')", "place_random()", "pick_up('green')", "place_on('red', 'top')"], "response": "Got a task, let's go!"}

    '''
```

Based on the system's language settings, configure the prompt words and select the appropriate large model for either the Chinese or English version.

**Initialization**

{lineno-start=116}
```python
action.ctl.set_pwm_servo_pulse(1, 1000, 500)
action.ctl.set_pwm_servo_pulse(2, 1500, 500)
action.AGC.runActionGroup("stand")

kws = awake.WonderEchoPro("/dev/ttyUSB0")
if language == "Chinese":
    asr = speech.RealTimeASR()
    tts = speech.RealTimeTTS()
    client = speech.OpenAIAPI(api_key, base_url)
else:
    asr = speech.RealTimeOpenAIASR()
    asr.update_session(model=asr_model, language="en")
    tts = speech.RealTimeOpenAITTS()
    client = speech.OpenAIAPI(vllm_api_key, vllm_base_url)
```

Configure the head pan-tilt servo and execute the **"stand"** action group to position the robot in a standing state.

Initialize the serial device number for WonderEcho Pro, then select the appropriate large model and language version (Chinese or English) according to the system language.

Set the volume of WonderEcho Pro to 80 and play the **"I am ready"** audio.

**Large Model Processing**

**Wake Word Detection**

{lineno-start=149}
```python
if kws.wakeup():  # Wake word has been detected (检测到唤醒词)
    speech.play_audio(wakeup_audio_path)
    asr_result = asr.asr()  # Start recording and recognition (开启录音识别)
    print("asr_result:", asr_result)
```

① `if kws.wakeup()`: Detects whether the wake word has been triggered. After detecting the wake word, the system will enter the recording and recognition phase:

② `speech.play_audio(wakeup_audio_path)`: Plays the wake-up audio file, signaling to the user that the device is now in standby mode.

③ `asr_result = asr.asr()`: Initiates audio recording and recognition, and records the speech content.

**Vision Language Model**

{lineno-start=157}
```python
try:
    result = client.vllm(asr_result, image, prompt=vllm_prompt, model=vllm_model)
    # Pass the recognition result to the agent for it to respond (将识别结果传给智能体让他来回答)
    print("vision_result:", result)
    print("question:", result + "," + asr_result)
```

If speech is recognized, capture the latest image frame. Pass both the latest image frame and the wake word to the vision language model, and retrieve the model's response.

**Large Language Model**

{lineno-start=161}
```python
result = client.llm(result + asr_result, prompt=llm_prompt, model=llm_model)
action_list, response = None, []
if "action" in result:  # If a corresponding action is returned, extract and process it （如果有对应的行为返回那么就提取处理）
    result = eval(result[result.find("{"):result.find("}") + 1])
    if "action" in result:
        action_list = result["action"]
    if "response" in result:
        response = result["response"]
else:  # If there's no corresponding action, just reply with the answer（没有对应的行为，只回答）
    response = result
```

`result = client.llm(result + asr_result, prompt=llm_prompt, model=llm_model)`: Combines the response from the Vision Language Model with the speech recognition result and sends them as a request to the large language model.

`result = eval(result[result.find('{'):result.find('}') + 1])`:
Uses the `eval` function to parse the JSON-formatted string and extract the action and response elements.

**Main program**

{lineno-start=204}
```python
def main():
    global running
    while running:
        try:
            if stop_camera:
                time.sleep(0.01)
            else:
                ret, image = cap.read()
                if ret:
                    if not image_queue.empty():
                        try:
                            image_queue.get_nowait()
                        except queue.Empty:
                            pass
                    try:
                        image_queue.put_nowait(image)
                    except queue.Full:
                        pass
                    cv2.imshow("track", image)
                    cv2.waitKey(1)
                else:
                    time.sleep(0.01)
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            kws.exit() 
            try:
                os.system("pinctrl FAN_PWM a0")
            except:
                pass
            break
    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

① `cap = cv2.VideoCapture(-1)`: Captures video from the default camera.

② `cv2.imshow()`: Displays the camera feed.

③ `cv2.release()`: Releases the camera resource.

④ `cv2.destroyAllWindows()`: Closes all video windows.

⑤ `try/except` block: Handles keyboard interrupt signals.
